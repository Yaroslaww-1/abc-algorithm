This repository is Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm implementation in Kotlin. It is based on article ["Vertex Coloring Based on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm"](https://omirzaei.github.io/assets/pdf/C2.pdf) by Vahid Chahkandi and Omid Mirzaei.

## testing
- Firstly, random 200-vertices graph was generated with vertex degrees from 1 up to 20.
- Than, algorithm was run 1000 times. Each iteration can improve our minimal chromatic number - bestResult.
- Every 20 iterations best result was printed and graphic was build:
